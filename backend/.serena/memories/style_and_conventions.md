- Go code follows Clean Architecture layering: domain entities/value objects kept pure; usecases orchestrate, infrastructure handles adapters.
- Keep packages under `internal/*` boundary; prefer dependency injection via interfaces in repository layer.
- Use Go's standard formatting (`gofmt`) and idiomatic naming (MixedCaps exported, lowerCamel internal). Errors wrapped via helpers in `pkg/errors`.
- Validation handled through `pkg/validator`; JWT concerns isolated in `pkg/jwt`.
- Configuration managed through `.env`; avoid hardcoding secrets; use struct tags for JSON binding.
- Tests run with `go test ./...`; prefer table-driven tests.
